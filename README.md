Matrix Printer is a tool that takes CSV, TSV or pasted data from Excel (delimiter is auto-detected), optionally groups it and formats it into continuous text using [Liquid](https://liquidjs.com/tutorials/intro-to-liquid.html) filters and templates.

It's a simple way to generate reports, emails, or any other text-based output from structured data. Also a great way to programmatically markup tabular data.
